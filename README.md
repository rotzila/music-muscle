### Calibration
This dispositive have a calibration mode, this is needed due to each human having different values in the same bio sensor. This calibration mode is activated by pressing the button for 2 seconds, the LED in the bottom will light up meaning the calibration mode is activated. During this period the user must be in a rest state for approximately 5 seconds, after this period the user must try to do the maximum strength possible. Pressing the button will deactivate the calibration mode, but, now with a new range adapted to the user in question. This range will give a range from 0 to 100 using the minimum and the maximum value gathered during the calibration mode.

## Music-Muscle-Song
